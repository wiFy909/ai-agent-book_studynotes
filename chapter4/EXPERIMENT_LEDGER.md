# Chapter 4 experiment ledger

This ledger separates execution coverage from the manuscript hypothesis and from external credential availability. `official_complete` is true only when every gate named by the manuscript has substantive real evidence. Mechanism tests and credential probes are retained, but never promoted as successful external executions.

## Experiment 4-1 — perception MCP

Manuscript gates: a real MCP catalog covering search, multimodal understanding, filesystem operations, public data, and authorized private data.

- Passed: real MCP `tools/list`; web and local-knowledge search; HTTPS download and webpage reading; PDF/DOCX/PPTX extraction; OCR; local Whisper transcription; video parsing; DashScope international `qwen-vl-max` image and video analysis with response IDs, token usage, and latency; confined file read/search/list/copy/move/delete; three escape probes; Open-Meteo, Yahoo Finance, exchange-rate, Wikipedia, and arXiv calls.
- Blocked: Google Calendar and Notion. No usable OAuth token or Notion integration credential exists in the environment. The failed calls and credential-free preflight are retained.
- Failed provenance retained: the first DashScope attempt used the mainland endpoint with an international-region key and received 401; the corrected run uses `dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com`.

## Experiment 4-2 — execution MCP

Manuscript gates: verified file write/edit, terminal timeout and dangerous-command review, sandboxed Python, long-output persistence, Excel operations, external system mutations, and browser/desktop/mobile execution.

- Passed: deterministic Python compiler and Node `--check` linter; structured invalid-code responses; workspace escape rejection; timeout; Kimi K3 dangerous-command rejection with raw usage/latency receipts; Docker Python sandbox (`--network none`, read-only root, memory/CPU/PID limits); immutable full long-output retention; XLSX formulas rendered through LibreOffice and PyMuPDF; real HTTPS webhook; real Chromium navigation and screenshot.
- Blocked: no Google Calendar/SMTP credentials or active Android/Computer Use session. The execution server has no environment GitHub token; an unrelated local CLI login was not silently repurposed for mutation.

## Experiment 4-3 — collaboration MCP

Manuscript gates: sync/async sub-agent lifecycle, messages, cancellation/status, two context-passing strategies, HITL requests with timeout/default behavior, and real multi-channel notification.

- Passed: real Kimi K3 minimal and LLM-generated handoffs, privacy filtering, raw model receipts, synchronous completion, asynchronous completion/status, follow-up messages, cancellation, a pending approval resolved through the admin MCP primitive, and a conservative timeout.
- Blocked: the validation operator is explicitly not claimed to be a human decision, and no real SMTP/Telegram/Slack credentials are configured. Placeholder `.env` values are forced empty by the campaign and cannot satisfy a gate.
- Failed provenance retained: the first live run polled the async task for only five seconds; the model completed after that window. The accepted blocked-evidence run uses a bounded twenty-second poll and passes the lifecycle gate.

## Experiment 4-4 — event-driven mailbox agent

Manuscript gates: three real inbound test-mailbox events processed FIFO: meeting/calendar conflict plus draft, complaint extraction plus high-priority notification, and marketing archive plus provider verification.

- The campaign fetched and hashed all eight official Unipile Email/Calendar schema documents and made credential-redacted live API probes.
- Blocked before mailbox mutation: the configured Unipile credential returns 401 with both documented `X-API-KEY` and diagnostic Bearer authentication. Therefore zero local/synthetic mail objects were substituted and no three-email success is claimed.

## Experiment 4-5 — interruptible asynchronous agent

All four exact manuscript scenarios passed with real OS subprocesses: a 3–5
second command remained non-blocking while the time question was answered;
queued instructions were appended once and produced a Japanese HTML artifact;
an interrupt terminated the real child process and the runtime recovered; and
the 3%/2%/1% parallel jobs triggered exactly one status query after the fast
job, preserved the >50% job, cancelled only the <=50% job, and produced a
hashed integrated report. The canonical summary is
`async-agent/validation/experiment_4_5/real_subprocess_20260730T052500Z/summary.json`.

## Experiment 4-6 — active tool discovery

The canonical campaign uses local Ollama `qwen3:4b`, 126 complete schemas
listed by the real perception MCP server, a 50,120-token schema catalog, a
local `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` index, five-schema user-history injection with a
cumulative status bar, and the three exact manuscript tasks in both arms. All
twelve formal gates are true. Both groups selected every required capability
and completed 3/3 tasks, so the manuscript's expected accuracy/completion
improvement was **not observed**: both arms scored 100%. Active discovery was
faster in this run (808.926 versus 2,590.820 seconds, 3.20×) and exposed much
less schema text (1,251 initial system tokens per treatment task plus 12,838
dynamic tokens across the group, versus 50,352 system tokens per control
task).

The successful aggregate must not be read as clean treatment behavior. On the
Apple task, Qwen first issued a vague discovery, malformed JSON, an irrelevant
Google search and a real but irrelevant `code_interpreter` call that wrote a
215-byte empty contributor chart; two premature finishes were rejected before
it discovered and executed `yfinance_quote` and `search_news`. The recovered
arXiv task retained two protocol parse errors and a redundant vague discovery.
Those trajectories remain in the canonical receipts.

Failed evidence is also preserved. The first exact campaign
`qwen3_4b_exact_20260730T061700Z` completed but had treatment at only 1/3 tasks
(manifest SHA-256
`e3b98be25fca51e3454e442f2e312ff84aad24c89c2d44a7c1e46628cdbebe09`).
The canonical v2 campaign's first terminal attempt hit real arXiv
429/503/disconnect failures; its final search succeeded only on turn 12, too
late to download. Its failed manifest SHA-256 is
`e18bc4465606087c195a2abafbd375048c2921233bae812ef3bc3f522eb9b86b`.
A bounded same-campaign resume archived that failed summary, manifest and task
receipt, reused the other five completed receipts, then made one fresh real
attempt. With the arXiv client page bounded to the requested three results,
the official endpoint succeeded on its first call and all three PDFs were
downloaded, signature-checked and hashed. No cached result or mock substituted
for either failed attempt.
