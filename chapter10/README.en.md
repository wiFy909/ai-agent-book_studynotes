# Chapter 10 · Multi-Agent Collaboration

> Collective intelligence can surpass individual intelligence. Multi-Agent classification framework, when it truly outperforms a single Agent, collaboration with and without shared context, failure modes, and the emergent "Agent Society."

## Companion Projects

| Exp. | Project | Type | Description |
| :--: | --- | :--: | --- |
| 10-1 | [staged-system-prompt](staged-system-prompt/) | ✅ | The same Coding Agent loads different system prompts and tool sets at different execution stages of a task (requirements clarification → code implementation → code review). This allows it to play different roles and exhibit different behaviors within a single conversation, while the dialogue history and task state are continuously shared between stages. If the review fails, it can fall back to the implementation stage. |
| 10-2 | [multi-role-transfer](multi-role-transfer/) | ✅ | Demonstrates chained handoff under a shared context: a single session contains multiple specialized role agents, each with its own system prompt and dedicated tool set. Using a `transfer_to_agent` tool, an agent autonomously decides when to switch to another role based on task progress. Because they share the same dialogue history, the complete context is naturally preserved during handoff. |
| 10-3 | [book-translation](book-translation/) | 🚧 | The four-role manager and single-agent control have a real-model small-sample run. Exact acceptance still requires the illustrated/code-heavy technical book specified by the prose and a complete quality, efficiency, token, and resource comparison. |
| 10-4 | `use-computer-while-calling/` | 📖 | External [TalkAct](https://github.com/19PINE-AI/TalkAct) at pinned commit `7d70007…`: concurrent fast/slow agents share an in-process `SharedState` blackboard (rolling digest, transcript/action log) and bidirectional text queues. This version is not a WebSocket bridge. The checkout is not bundled; see the main README appendix for the exact clone command and benchmark entrypoint. |
| 10-5 | [autonomous-phone-registration](autonomous-phone-registration/) | 🚧 | A real Playwright form observation and real LLM autonomously decide whether to call `initiate_phone_call_agent`; the consent-gated Twilio/local path supports validation, re-asking, concurrent ask/fill, redacted traces, and opt-in submission. Current committed evidence proves browser/LLM/concurrency with scripted answers only; PSTN and human audio remain `not_run`, so live acceptance is incomplete. |
| 10-6 | [parallel-web-research](parallel-web-research/) | ✅ | N independent Playwright browser sessions search ten real university sites while a real LLM extracts cited evidence. Saved acceptance covers monitoring, timeout/error isolation, single settlement, cascading termination acknowledgements, resource cleanup, and a measured 3.142× same-site parallel speedup. |
| 10-7 | `generative_agents/` | 📖 | Stanford's "AI town" generative agents (companion to Experiment 10-7); external repository `joonspk-research/generative_agents`, which you need to clone yourself (see the main README appendix). |
| 10-8 | [voice-werewolf](voice-werewolf/) | 🚧 | Implements the consent-gated 6–8-seat live path (one human, 5–7 real AI players), exact roles, microphone ASR/TTS/barge-in, three-cycle, strategy, isolation, and rule-based winner gates. No authorized human was supplied and both safe Audio API probes returned `insufficient_quota`; live audio/cycles/strategy remain unrun and supplemental all-AI paths are not acceptance. |
