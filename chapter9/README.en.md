# Chapter 9 · Multimodal and Real-Time Interaction

> Extends perception and action from text to voice, GUI, and the physical world. Three voice paradigms (cascaded/end-to-end full-modal/full-duplex), streaming voice perception and synthesis, Computer Use, and robotic manipulation.

## Companion Projects

| Exp. | Project | Type | Description |
| :--: | --- | :--: | --- |
| 9-1 | [live-audio](live-audio/) | ✅ | A real-time voice chat demo integrating speech-to-text, AI dialogue, and text-to-speech. Supports multiple AI service providers (OpenAI, OpenRouter, ARK, Siliconflow), providing a low-latency conversational experience. |
| 9-2 | [phone-agent](phone-agent/) | 🚧 | The official `pine-voice` SDK direct/ReAct paths are implemented, but no authorized, consenting E.164 destination was supplied. The preflight records no dial and no transcript; test doubles do not count as acceptance. |
| 9-3 | [streaming-speech](streaming-speech/) | ✅ | Demonstrates the core trade-off of streaming speech perception: chunk continuous audio into segments of increasing length and feed them to the ASR. Each received segment produces a "current partial recognition result" to achieve extremely low first-chunk latency for early text output. The cost is that early chunks, lacking the context of the latter half of the sentence, may be erroneous, gradually converging as audio accumulates. This contrasts with the high-accuracy/high-latency approach of "waiting for the entire sentence before recognition." |
| 9-4 | [end-to-end-speech](end-to-end-speech/) | 🚧 | The exact Step-Audio R1 customized-vLLM deployment and real audio client are implemented, but this host has neither a reachable Step-Audio endpoint nor CUDA; blocker evidence fails closed instead of substituting another model. |
| 9-5 | [controllable-tts](controllable-tts/) | 🚧 | A real Fish Audio S1 4×3×2 reference library and A/B/C media pass structural gates; the qualitative listening study and “near-human customer service” evaluation are still missing. |
| 9-6 | `claude-quickstarts/computer-use-demo/` | 📖 | External `anthropics/claude-quickstarts` checkout pinned to `9bcc95e…`; the exact Computer Use demo is its containerized Ubuntu desktop/Claude agent loop, not the whole quickstarts collection. |
| 9-7 | `browser-use/` | 📖 | External `browser-use/browser-use` checkout pinned to `ec9277c…`; the prose task uses the visual CLI (`use_vision=True`) to search Google for San Francisco weather and retain the action/screenshot trajectory. |
| 9-8 | [xlerobot-teleoperation](xlerobot-teleoperation/) | 📖 | External XLeRobot pinned to `3d14695…` for keyboard/Xbox/Joy-Con/VR teleoperation. Only source/non-actuating preflight exists; no authorized four-mode hardware run or pick/place/wipe evidence. |
| 9-9 | [gemini-xlerobot-navigation](gemini-xlerobot-navigation/) | 📖 | External XLeRobot `3d14695…` plus RoboCrew, using exactly `gemini-robotics-er-1.5-preview`, angle annotation, and forward/left/right tools. No authorized robot/navigation run exists. |
| 9-10 | [rgb-sim2real-grasping](rgb-sim2real-grasping/) | 📖 | External `lerobot-sim2real` pinned to `87d6c1d…` for the five-stage RGB→PPO→SO-100 pipeline. The host lacks ManiSkill/NVIDIA and no authorized physical robot run exists. |
